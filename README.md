# DL_Project_AndyBakir
Andy's Project based on Graph Representation and Algorithms

My presentation is in 2 parts:

Part 1 https://youtu.be/tbhqWvUx6Eo

Part 2 https://youtu.be/9sk-mzgBX64

I first go over graphs in discrete mathematics and how it was founded, basically a brief history. Then I explain the mathematical definition of a graph as I talk about the edges, vertices, and nodes. As well as what data structure which in this case is sets and pairs. I have code examples for all types of representations, which I also have on my source code. 

Source code:
Under src file I have my source code listed for all my code listed in the video

References:
I used parts of our textbook for reference, as well as 
https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/representing-graphs-in-data-structures/

This article helped me grasp the general idea of coding using graphs.
